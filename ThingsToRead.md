This looks good: 4GB RAM, $99, 5 to 10 watts

To avoid Jetson Nano file permission errors:

Flash cannot be done from Windows (the flash binary is a Linux executable). If Windows was used, then it means a VM was used. A VM can work (usually takes some work to get USB to pass through correctly and is not officially supported), but if NTFS was used and not a native ext4 Linux file system, then what got flashed is incorrect and it must be flashed again. The entire file system will be subject to incorrect permissions...thousands of files will slowly show up as wrong over time."
