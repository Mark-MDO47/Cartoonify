NVIDIA Jetson Nano implementation of Dan MacNish brilliant "Draw This" camera
Apologies to Dan if I didn't capitalize the name correctly...

Planning to use the new NVIDIA Jetson Nano to implement this with a few cosmetic enhancements

$99, 5-10 watts, 4GB RAM, Jetson Nano module installed (NVIDIA Maxwell™ architecture with 128 NVIDIA CUDA® cores)

I had previously attempted this project with a Raspberry PI 3 but ran into lack of RAM (1GB maximum).
Also lots of configuration changes gave issues, what with Google TensorFlow updating so quickly and requiring changes to the NVIDA CUDA library to match it - don't get me started on overhead of keeping tools in sync!

I considered the Google Coral Dev Board, but ultimately its 1GB RAM (and my PC with an NVIDA GTX-1080 card) pushed me the other way.

Just getting started now.
